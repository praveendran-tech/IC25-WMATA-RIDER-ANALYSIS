# ðŸš† WMATA Metro Rail Ridership Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes WMATA (Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority) metro rail ridership data to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization. The analysis incorporates **real-time and historical data** from multiple sources to develop **AI-driven strategies** for enhancing ridership, revenue, and commuter experience.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Ridership Data Analysis:** Examined **10M+ ride entries** across **50+ metro stations**.
- **Revenue Leakage:** Identified **$3.6M+ annual loss** due to fare discrepancies.
- **Peak Hour Congestion:** Bottlenecks in morning and evening rush hours.
- **Weather Impact:** Ridership fluctuates **-25% in winter** and **+20% in spring**.
- **Crime & Safety:** High-crime metro stations show **10-15% lower ridership**.
- **Post-COVID Ridership Shift:** Remote work and safety concerns slowed recovery.

## ðŸš€ Proposed Solutions
âœ… **AI-Powered Predictive Models** â€“ Optimizing metro schedules based on real-time demand.
âœ… **Smart Fare Automation** â€“ Eliminating revenue loss via improved tap-in/tap-out tracking.
âœ… **Crime Analytics & Surveillance** â€“ Enhancing safety through real-time crime detection.
âœ… **Seasonal Demand Adjustments** â€“ Adapting train frequency based on weather and events.
âœ… **Dynamic Pricing Strategies** â€“ Encouraging off-peak travel through fare incentives.
